Photos of the Day
=================

Photos-of-the-Day is a program that helps you to show the photos that you have stored in your own photo archive.  
Nowadays, people often take a lot of pictures, they will then just store the photos in some storage (i.e. external harddrive) and forget about it.  
This program promotes the viewing of your photos by helping you to randomly pick photos out of your photo archive.  
A typical use is to then share the chosen photos on Dropbox Photos folder.
