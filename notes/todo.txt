-generate the summary file
-pick numbers as well as percentage
-refactor to functions
-readme file to show usage
-after 2nd level directory pick, check to see if there are image files first before going to next stage
-optimize the case if pick number or percentage is high enough (i.e. pick number == number of files), 
 then should not use random pick because this will very long to complete
-build in some smartness:
 -track history picks to avoid picking the same album
 -take user preference to lean towards certain directory (e.g. 1st level: I want to see something in year 2000 to 2004)
