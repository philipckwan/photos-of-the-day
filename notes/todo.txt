--------------------------
Enhancements, thoughts:

DONE-support 3rd level directory

-maybe instead of relying on the 2 directory level structure, this app should also support just picking random photos from a folder of many photos
 -that means there will not be a title, or the tile is meaningless
 
-pick numbers as well as percentage

-after 2nd level directory pick, check to see if there are image files first before going to next stage
-if load to dropbox folder, consider delete the previous directory 
 -under Photos/Photos_of_the_day
  -remove the previous directory
  -create a new directory for today's run
 -consider have a staging directory for approval before send out 

-my current photo archive is skewed having many folders at the older years (2004-2010), so they are always picked
 -how to balance this better? more folders vs more pictures in a folder (i.e. recent ones that are unorganized)

-build in some smartness:
 -track history picks to avoid picking the same album
 -take user preference to lean towards certain directory (e.g. 1st level: I want to see something in year 2000 to 2004)
 -consider a chat agent (could be HTTP REST based as a start) to interact with to give directions and get properties
 
-error checking
 -validate source and destination directories

DONE:

DONE-readme file to show usage

DONE-readme contents
 -motivates me to better organize my picture
 -motivates me to delete bad pictures
 -motivates me to take better pictures ;-P

FIXED-optimize the algorithm so that it doesn't need to detect the media type (to check that it is jpg image) for all files in the chosen folder
 -perhaps only do it after the file/photo is chosen
 -example test timing on puerto_rico: 
  -before:11400,11724,11706,11905,11407
  -after:584,619,576,659,618
  
YES-can this app handle png image?

FIXED-fail for this directory: D:\desktop_backups\all\_B01_my_album_new\2004_to_2009-work_US\20090612-from doris camera
 -because it only contains 2 sub-directories

FIXED-fail

v-generate the summary file
 v-email template
 v-some statistics (e.g. number of picks / number of total files in folder -> percentage)
v-FIXED-seems to occasionally run into ConcurrentModificationException

v-refactor to functions
v-optimize the case if pick number or percentage is high enough (i.e. pick number == number of files), 
 then should not use random pick because this will very long to complete
 v-should simply just leverage the File[] to pick the files, instead of putting it into a map
 v-now convert the File[] to LinkedList<File>, and use the remove(random) to get the files
