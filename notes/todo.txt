--------------------------
Issues:

-what if 2 folders have the same name?
-separate out the 2 traverse and pick strategies and maybe modularize it
-if the property "howManyPhotosToPick" is bigger than the picked folder's number of photos
 the resulting email has a wrong count
 e.g. howManyPhotosToPick=20
 folder has only 10 photos
 the email will say that "10 photos are picked out of 20 ==> 50.0%"
DONE-can the counting of files ignore dot (.) files?

-bug suspected: in the folder "20190209-2-kids_pbk_photos/ella_picked", there are 82 photos. I run with both howManyPhotosToPick with 82 or 100,
 still only able to pick 80 photos. not sure why 2 photos are never picked


--------------------------
Enhancements, thoughts:

DROP-mavenize so that I can invoke it using mvn command
 -since this is a standalone java app, it is not straightforward to run using the maven command
  also, the library dependencies have to be provided as well
 

-maybe instead of relying on the 2 directory level structure, this app should also support just picking random photos from a folder of many photos
 -that means there will not be a title, or the tile is meaningless
 
-pick numbers as well as percentage

-after 2nd level directory pick, check to see if there are image files first before going to next stage
-if load to dropbox folder, consider delete the previous directory 
 -under Photos/Photos_of_the_day
  -remove the previous directory
  -create a new directory for today's run
 -consider have a staging directory for approval before send out 

-my current photo archive is skewed having many folders at the older years (2004-2010), so they are always picked
 -how to balance this better? more folders vs more pictures in a folder (i.e. recent ones that are unorganized)

-build in some smartness:
 -track history picks to avoid picking the same album
 -take user preference to lean towards certain directory (e.g. 1st level: I want to see something in year 2000 to 2004)
 -consider a chat agent (could be HTTP REST based as a start) to interact with to give directions and get properties
 
 
-------------------------- 
DONE:

DONE-add a property to pre-pick the folder, if found in the map list of folder, then use that one
 DONE-purpose of this is for me to try to repick the photos from the same folder

DONE-please test with this folder "200406-family trip" as it has more than 3 layers of folders, and at the 3 level, it only contains .mov files
 DONE-maybe it will work with my new strategy --> ANSWER: YES! GOOD!
 
DONE-new strategy - more intelligent when traversing the folders
-have 2 lists: listFolderOfFolders, listFolderOfPhotos
 -listFolderOfFolders contain all folders that have sub-folders
  -i.e. root folder is an example
 -listFolderOfPhotos contain all folders that directly have files (not yet decided whether I should filter out folders that have files but no photo, currently out of scope)
 -a folder can be in both list at the same time (i.e. a folder that has photos as well as sub-folders
 -by doing this, I can support pre-picking folder
  -if pre-pick a folder that have sub-folders, the run will only consider the sub-folders
  -find all the folders under this folder in the listFolderOfPhotos, then do the random pick of folder, then photos
  -if pre-pick a folder that is leaf, then just start picking the photos.


OK-error checking
 -validate source and destination directories

DONE-support 3rd level directory

DONE-readme file to show usage

DONE-readme contents
 -motivates me to better organize my picture
 -motivates me to delete bad pictures
 -motivates me to take better pictures ;-P

FIXED-optimize the algorithm so that it doesn't need to detect the media type (to check that it is jpg image) for all files in the chosen folder
 -perhaps only do it after the file/photo is chosen
 -example test timing on puerto_rico: 
  -before:11400,11724,11706,11905,11407
  -after:584,619,576,659,618
  
YES-can this app handle png image?

FIXED-fail for this directory: D:\desktop_backups\all\_B01_my_album_new\2004_to_2009-work_US\20090612-from doris camera
 -because it only contains 2 sub-directories

v-refactor to functions
v-optimize the case if pick number or percentage is high enough (i.e. pick number == number of files), 
 then should not use random pick because this will very long to complete
 v-should simply just leverage the File[] to pick the files, instead of putting it into a map
 v-now convert the File[] to LinkedList<File>, and use the remove(random) to get the files
